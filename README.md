# StreetEasy-Apartment-Prices-Predictor
In this project, I test out the Linear Regression package in Scikit-Learn to predict rental prices from StreetEasy's Manhatten Apartments dataset.

## My Goals for This Project

This was a shorter project where I wanted to practice more of my Python skills with regressions. As I have much more experience in R, I wanted to learn and test out some of the features provided in the Scikit-Learn package for multiple regressions, while I learned through CodeAcademy. Therefore, this project is not as in-depth as my other independent projects, but does build a framework for the data science process in Python.

## Dataset

The dataset is provided by StreetEasy; New York City's leading real estate marketplace. StreetEasy partnered with CodeAcademy to assist with learning about Multiple Linear Regressions.

## Process Used
* Loading the dataset
* Exploring the dataset
* Splitting the data into training and testing datasets
* Building a multiple linear regression model
* Using the model to predict on the testing dataset, analyze the results and accuracy of the dataset

## Further Improvements

I am happy with the project as it has served my purpose of exploring the sci-kit learn package and exploring their multiple regression functions. If I get time, I would like to expand on this project by:

* model selection for variables
* trying a logistic regression for better accuracy
* pulling data from other boroughs in NYC (Brooklyn, Queens etc) to compare how this Manhattan Rental Price Predictor compares to them.
